## <u>Introduction</u>

Dash is a personal planner app which offers unparalleled speed using text-based input. It supports both management of
tasks and contacts. Dash is tailored to the needs of university students, who must keep track of a slew of different 
deadlines, commitments, and contacts. So long as you're a fast typist, Dash provides a blisteringly quick way to stay 
on top of your responsibilities.

This guide was written to help you set up and start using Dash. If you're a new user, the Quick Start guide has all you 
need to get started. If you're an intermediate user looking to get more out of Dash, all supported commands are listed 
below.

## <u>Setting up Dash</u>

On most modern operating systems like Windows or macOS, the steps for installation are the same.

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. 
   [Not sure what Java is? Click here!](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html)

2. Download the latest `dash.jar` from [this website](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.4).

3. Put the `dash.jar` file in the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Dash. This is where your data will 
   be stored.
   -  _We suggest creating a folder called "Dash" and putting the `dash.jar` file inside it. You can place this folder 
      wherever you want. Next, we recommend that you create a shortcut for Dash by right-clicking on the `dash.jar` 
      file. On Windows, click on the `Create Shortcut` option while on macOS, click on `Make Alias`. You can then put 
      this shortcut in a convenient place (such as your Desktop) for easy access._


4. Double-click the file to start the app. Here's what you should see in a few seconds:<br>
   ![Ui](images/UG-00.png)
   
5. That's all you need to do for the setup. To get started writing commands, refer to the Getting Started section 
   [below](#getting-started).

## <u>Getting Started</u>

### <u>Overview</u>

Dash supports contact and task management in several ways. 

In terms of contact management, Dash allows you to add contacts and fill in details such as their 
phone number, address, and email. 
It even allows you to group them using tags such as "Neighbour" or "Colleague", so you can look them up more easily. 

For task management, Dash allows you to add tasks, tag them, and set deadlines for them. 
Once you're done with a task, you can mark it as complete. 
You can view a list of your incomplete tasks sorted by their due date so that you can prioritise the most pressing 
deadlines.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### <u>Tab System</u>

![Switching Tabs](images/UG-01.png)

The image above shows the tab system of Dash, which allows it to keep your contacts and tasks separate.
To view and edit your contact list, you must switch to the contacts tab.
Similarly, to view and edit your task list, you must switch to the tasks tab.
Finally, the help tab provides you with a quick summary of Dash's features and how to use them.

[[Back to Table of Contents]](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### <u>Command Line Interface</u>

Dash uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) to optimize speed. This means that instead of using your mouse to click 
through menus, you mostly use your keyboard to interact with Dash by typing in **commands**. 

**Commands** are how you tell Dash to do things. The first word you type in is the **command word** which lets Dash 
know what kind of command you are inputting. Some types of commands require other inputs after the first word: these 
are known as **arguments**. These arguments are usually made up of a **prefix** and a **parameter**. 

In the example below, the command word is `add`, and the argument `n/Alice Yeoh` is made up of the prefix `n/` and the 
parameter `Alice Yeoh`. This tells Dash to add a contact with name `Alice Yeoh`.

```aidl
add n/Alice Yeoh
```

To execute the command, simply type `add n/Alice Yeoh` in the command box and press enter.

The format of each command must be followed precisely, or the command won't work.

If you're a beginner user, you might get the command format wrong. That's ok! Your input simply won't be recognised by
Dash, and will remain in the command box. You can then modify your input and press Enter to try to execute the
command again.

Here are more example commands you can try:

* **`help`** : Switches to the help tab

* **`tasks`** : Switches to the tasks tab

* **`exit`** : Exits the app.

You can find the details of all commands in the [Features section](#features) below.

## <u>Features</u>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

<a name="command-format-info"></a>
**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

Here's how to read the given command formats:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` denote parameters.<br>
  e.g. If the format is `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which should be replaced by the name of the contact you 
  want to add.

* Arguments in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. If the format is `add n/NAME [t/TAG]`, since `TAG` is optional, both `add n/John Doe t/friend` and 
  `add n/John Doe` are accepted by Dash. However, since `NAME` is not optional, `add t/friend` is not accepted.

* Arguments with `â€¦` after them can be used more than once.<br>
  e.g. If the format is `tag t/TAG...` can be used as `tag t/friend`, `tag t/friend t/colleague`, `tag t/friend t/colleague t/boss` 
  etc.<br>

**:information_source: Notes about specifying Date and Time:**
A task can optionally have a Date, or both a Date and a Time.

`add [dt/DATE] [dt/TIME] [dt/DATE, TIME]`

* When only Date is specified in the _Add_ command, a task will only have the specified Date.
* When only Time is specified in the _Add_ command, a task will have today's Date and the specified Time.
* When both Date and Time are specified in the _Add_ command, a task will have both of the specified Date and Time.

`edit [dt/DATE] [dt/TIME] [dt/DATE, TIME]`

* When only Date is specified in the _Edit_ command, a task will only have its Date changed to the specified Date.
* When only Time is specified in the _Edit_ command, a task will only have its Time changed to the specified Time.
* When both Date and Time are specified in the _Edit_ command, a task will have both of its Date and Time changed to the specified Date and Time.

**:warning: Multiple Date/Time parameters:**<br>
All commands that accept Date/Time parameters (_Add_, _Edit_, _Find_ commands) expect only one Date/Time parameter. 
If you specify multiple Date/Time parameters, only the last Date/Time parameter will be taken.<br>
e.g. if you specify `dt/12/02/2021 dt/1900`, only `dt/1900` will be taken.
